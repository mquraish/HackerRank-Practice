You are given a class Solution and its main method in the editor. In each test cases, it takes an input ch which represents a choice of the following:

 ch=1 represents the volume of a cube that has to be calculated where  represents the length of the sides of the cube.

 ch=2 represents the volume of a cuboid that has to be calculated where  represent the dimensions of a cuboid.

 ch=3 represents the volume of a hemisphere that has to be calculated where  represents the radius of a hemisphere.

 ch=4 represents the volume of a cylinder that has to be calculated where  represent the radius and height of the cylinder respectively.

Your task is to create the class Calculate and the required methods so that the code prints the volume of the figures rounded to exactly  decimal places.

In case any of the dimensions of the figures are <=0 , print "java.lang.NumberFormatException: All the values must be positive" without quotes and terminate the program.

Note: Use Math.PI or 3.14159265 as the value of pi.
